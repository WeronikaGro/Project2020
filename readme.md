# Description : 
A humidity and temperature sensor for a pet enclosure - e.g amphibians, insects, reptiles etc - which has a spray bottle attatched to it. This spray bottle will be activated when the humidity levels reach a certain low. The spray bottle can also be activated by command using a phone - e.g twitter? This device (arduino) can be attatched to the outside of the enclosure with the nozzle of the bottle and sensors inside. A live feed of the temperature and humidity will be available - dashboard. Device with spray bottle could also be used for plants - sensors in soil too.

## Tools, Technologies, Equipment :
- Temperature & Humidity sensor (DHT11)
- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Spray Bottle 
- Something that could activate spray bottle (servo) - pull back trigger
- Strong wires + metal for nozzle
- Twitter / Website for updates
